#### You should be able to see the items that you have added. You can increase/decrease the quantity of item and the subtotal reflects on the right amount. If you wish to compare 2 or 3 items, drag the items and drop them to the Wishlist and click "Compare".

#### You can compare the items by their description, price, and nutrition. The nutrition box needs more work, as we ran out of the time. This is one of few stretch goals that we can work on.
